# gmesh
We use gsplat to render 3D Gaussians and PyTorch3D to render 3D meshes. GMesh enabling the rendering of scenes composed of both 3D Gaussians and 3D meshes. Since both gsplat and PyTorch3D are PyTorch-based and support gradients, our hybrid rendering pipeline, GMesh, is fully differentiable and compatible with backpropagation.
