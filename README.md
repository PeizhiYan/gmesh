**Current Version**: v0.1 (July 02, 2025)

## TL;DR

- Combining Gaussians and meshes lets you leverage the strengths of both for more flexible and realistic 3D scene rendering.
- Gmesh supports differentiable rendering of mixed 3D Gaussians and meshes within a single scene.
- Built on gsplat and PyTorch3D, Gmesh is fully PyTorch-native.


## Usage

Please see ```./examples```.


## Setup


```bash
# create conda virtual environment
conda create --name gmesh -y python=3.10
conda activate gmesh

# install cuda toolkit
conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1" cuda-toolkit ninja
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.7 cudatoolkit-dev=11.7

# install PyTorch
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

# install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install Gmesh
pip install -e .
```

> [!TIP]
> I have only tested the following library versions:
> ```CUDA 11.7```, ```PyTorch 2.0.1```, ```PyTorch3D V0.7.8```, and ```gsplat v1.5.2```.
> If you encounter any issues or unexpected results, please double-check that you have installed the correct versions.
