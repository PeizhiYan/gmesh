**Current Version**: v0.1 (July 02, 2025)

## TL;DR

- Combining Gaussians and meshes lets you leverage the strengths of both for more flexible and realistic 3D scene rendering.
- Gmesh supports differentiable rendering of mixed 3D Gaussians and meshes within a single scene.
- Built on gsplat and PyTorch3D, Gmesh is fully PyTorch-native.


## Usage
